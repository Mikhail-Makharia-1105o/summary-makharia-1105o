            <p class="main-conspect-description">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
                It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</p>

            <p class="main-conspect-description">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
                and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

            <p class="main-conspect-description">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
                As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                 JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
                 It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
                 It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
                 It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

            <p class="main-conspect-description">GitHub, Inc. is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git, allowing developers to store and manage their code. 
                It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. 
                Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.
                It is commonly used to host open source software development projects. 
                As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 372 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. 
                It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023.</p>

            <p class="main-conspect-description">Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
                Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. 
                Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.</p>
